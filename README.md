# Prediction-Allocation 2 Step  Portfolio optimization model by DLinear
Effective diversification reduces portfolio risk. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model with a prediction-allocation structure for portfolio optimization. In the prediction step, we use DLinear which has excellent results, simple structure and saves computational resources, and in the allocation step we generate portfolio weight using Sharpe ratio as a loss function. We also back tested the model between 2021/01/01~2022/01/01 and obtained a better return.
